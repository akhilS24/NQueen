# NQueen

Hey programmers,

Ever wondered how to place n queens in an n*n chessboard such that they don't attack each other.
For a 8*8 chess board there are almost 4,426,165,368 possible ways of arranging 8 identical queens.
It's an  interesting fact that there are only 12 configurations you can set up so that the queens don't attack each other.
I came across this easy but yet efficient algorithm to find a possible configuration,the Backtracking algorithm.


# I made use of the pygame module to visualize how the algorithm works.
# Run the n_queen script
# Try to give input dim> 20 to get a clear cut idea about how the algorithm works
